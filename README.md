# Maze Walker
a game played on 'Maze Maker' mazes. 
A maze is created and then a navigator must run around the maze collecting dots.
Use the arrow keys to move.

TODO:

- DONE. add scoreboard for each dot collected
- add difficulty setting button
- add timer? (dots will then move arbitrarily if not collected within a time limit)
